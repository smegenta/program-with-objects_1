		  			<p> The objective of this section is to learn the Python programming language to generate the html page for the webpage we are building. In doing so, we will lean how to make a computer do what it is best at, which is doing repititive tasks very quickly.</p>

		  			<p><b>A Computer </b> - A computer is a universal machine that can be programmed to do any computation.</p>

		  			<p><b>A Program </b> - A program is a sequence of steps that tells the computer what to do. There are many different languages for programming computer. One of these languages is called Python </p>

		  			<p><b>Python </b> - Python is a high level programming language. Python is called interpretor becuase it interprests the program we write to a language the computer understands and executes it. </p>

		  			<p> A computer program need to be unambigious so that the computer executes exactly the same thing the programmer wants it to do. Unlike human languages, which tends to be verbose, a computer program has to describe its instruction consisely. Like human languages, computer programming languages also have grammars, but unlike human languages, they have to be followed precisely.</p>

		  				<li> - Both single and double quotes can be used, as long as opening and closing quotes are the same.
		  				<li> - Strings can be assigned to variables. 
		  				<li> - '+' operator for stings is a concatenation operator. It concatenates two strings into a new string.
		  				<li> - In Python '=' is an assignment statement, not an equal sign.
		  			</ul>
		  			<p>We can not use the '+' operators with strings and numbers , but "*" can be used and it means repeating the string as many times as specified in the operation. </p>

		  			<p>Individual characters within a string can be accessed by the index [] operator. Index starts from 0. We can also have negative index numbers. When used, they mean to start at the end of the string and go to the left. </p>

		  			<p>The operator <span class="code"> string[exp1:exp2] </span> is used to select a substring of a string starting at index exp1 and ending at index (exp2-1)</p>

		  			<p>The find method <span class="code"> string.find(sub_string) </span> can be used to find the first occurnace of the substring in a string. By adding one more paramter <span class="code"> string.find(sub_string, position) </span>, the find method can be used to find the occurance of the sub string after the specified position of the string.

		  		<div class ="sub-lesson-desc">
		  			<p> In this section of the course we learn about Functions, Classes and Object Oriented Programming. We will do so by building three projects: Break Scheduler, Profanity Editor and Movie Database. Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm used by most programmers </p>

		  			Procedural Programming
		  		</div>
		  		<div class ="sub-lesson-desc">
		  			<p> Procedural programming is a paradigm where a program is written explictly as a sequence of steps to be followed to produce a result. To make programming easier, a prolem is broken down into smaller logical pieces and procedures/functions are written for each piece. The procedures/functions have no intrinsic relationship with the data they operate on. Data is separate from fuctions. Examples of procedural programming languages include C and Pascal. </p>

		  		<div class = "sub-lesson-title">
		  			Object oriented Programming
		  		</div>
		  		<div class ="sub-lesson-desc">
		  			<p>In object oriented programming, data and related functions are bundled together to form objects with the data in the objected accessed or manipulated by functions of the object. The objects are used to model real-world objects (such as a person). Objects can have relationship with other objects.(A parent object will have son objects and so on). programs are designed such that objects interact with one another. Examples of Object Oriented programming languages include Python, C++ and Java.</p>

		  			<p>The first step in OOP is to identify all the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and how they relate to each other. Once an object has been identified, it is generalized as a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and functions(methods) that can manipulate it. Objects communicate with messages.</p>

		  			Abstractions
		  		</div>
		  		<div class ="sub-lesson-desc">
		  			<p>Python has an extensive list of built-in fuctions that we can use by simply calling them. Since these functions are already included in Python, we do not need to define them, nor are we concerned with the details of their implementation. To use them, we only need to know what they do, their inputs and their outputs. Examples of these type of functions include string functions such as len(), split() and so on. </p>

		  			<p>The ability to use functions without bothering about the details of their implementation is called <b>abstraction.</b></p>

		  			<p>An example of an Abstraction is the use of CSS tags in HTML. Once a CSS tag is defined in the CSS file, we are not concerned about the definition when using it. We refernce it in the header of the HTML file and use the tags that are defined in CSS file in the body of the HTML file.</p>

		  			<p><b>import:</b></p>

		  					<p>To use these fuctions in your program, you will need to first import the module. This is done by using the import statement. </p>

					Classes 
				</div>
				<div class="sub-lesson-desc">
					Classes can be thought of as blueprints for creating objects. As we work on complex problems, we will find that the data types that are pre-defined in Python are not adequate for describing the entities (objects) we want to work with. In such cases, we define classes that will be used to create the objects. Objects are instances of the classes</p>

					<p>For example, if our program is about drawing square, we need a square object. To create a square object, we first create a square class and use it to create the square objects.</p>

					Creating instances
				</div>
				<div class="sub-lesson-desc">
					<p>Instances of a class (objects) are creating by initialiing the object using the <span class="code">__init__()</span> function. The init function, though, is not directly called. Objects are initialized using the class names. Doing so indirectly calls the the <span class="code">__init__() </span> function to initialize the object.</p>

					<p>Example: Objects for the turtle and TwilioRestClient (from the video lectures) are created with the following statements respectively.</p>
					<p><span class="code">angie = turtle.Turtle()<br>
					client = rest.TwilioRestClient()</p></span>

					<p>Once an object (an instance of a class) has been created, we use it with the functions that are valid for that class.</p> 

					<p>Example: With the angie and client objects, we can now do: </p>
					<p><span class="code">angie.forward(100) <br>
					client.smc()</p></span>
					<p>where <span class="code">forward</span> and <span class="code">sms</span> are functions defined in the <span class="code">turtle</span> and <span class="code">TwilioRestClient</span> classes respectively.</p>

					Defining Classes 
				</div>
				<div class="sub-lesson-desc">
					<p>Classes are defined using the <span class="code">class</span> statement followed by the name of the class. Use upper case letter for the first letter of the class name. (Google Python Style Guide) </p>

					<p>The attributes of a class are its data members which describe (model) what the class (and its instances) need to remember and its methods, which are functions that are defined inside the class and model what things the class needs to do.</p>

					<p>Class methods are defined just like other functions except that the first argument method is <em>self</em>. 

					</p> Within the class definition, we use <span class="code">self</span> to refer to the instance of a class.

					<p>Example of a class:</p>

					<span class="code">
						class Movie ():<br>
						<span class="tab">def __init__ (self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image, trailer_youtube):<br>
        				<span class="dtab">self.storyline = movie_storyline<br>
        				<span class="dtab">self.poster_image_url = poster_image<br>
        				<span class="dtab">self.trailer_youtube_url = trailer_youtube<br>
        				<span class="tab">def show_trailer(self):<br>
        				<span class="dtab">webbrowser.open(self.trailer_youtube_url)</span>

					__init__()

				<div class="sub-lesson-desc">
						
					<p>__Init__ () is a special method in Python. It is also called <em>constructor</em> and is called when we create a new instance of a class. The double underscore before and after the name is used to tell that it is a special reserved word.

					<p>When we create an instance of a class, its init method is called, which creates/reserves spaces in memory for the class instnace and it intiatlizes the members of the instance with default/given values.</p>

					Instance vs. Class variables 
				</div>
				<div class="sub-lesson-desc">
					<p>Class variables are defined outside of the methods of the class and can be directly referenced from the class. Class variables can be useful for constants that will need to be used by all instances of the class, or that are meant to be accessed directly from the class. A good example is the movie ratings of the Movie class we saw during the vide lecture.</p> 

					<p>Instance variables are defined inside __init__ (), and they are local to an instance.</p>

					Pre-existing Class variables 
				</div>
				<div class="sub-lesson-desc">
					<p>Python comes with pre-existing variables for classes. Some of them are:
					
					<p>__doc__: When we define a class we can also write the documentation for them in the body of the class definition as a string surrounded by three double quotes.</p> 
					<p>__module__: This is the name of the module in which the class is defined. </p>

					<p>__name__: Every Python module/program has a variable defined called __name__ which is set to '__main__' when the program is run by itself. If it is imported to another program, it is set to the name of the module

					Inheritance 
				</div>
				<div class="sub-lesson-desc">
					<p>Inheritance is used to indicate that one class will get most or all of its features from another parent class. if you define a class as </p>

					<p><span class="code"> class Child(Parent)</span></p>

					<p> It means the class Child will inherit from class Parent</p>

					<p> When the constructor for the child class is invoked, it in turn will invoke the constructor of the parent class. The members of the child class that are already defined in the parent class get initialized by the parent constructor. Then members of the class that are not initialized by the prent class constructor will be initialized by the child class constructor.</p>

					Method Overriding 
				</div>
				<div class="sub-lesson-desc">
					<p>In Inheritance, Child classes not only inherit the variables of the parent class but it also inherits the parent's methods. So even if a method is not explicitly defined in a child class, as long as it is defined in the parent class, it can be called from instances of the child class.</p>

					<p>A method that is defined in a parent class can also be re-defined in the child class. This is usually done when the Child class implements the method in a different way. In this case when an instance of the parent class call the method, the version defined in the parent class will be executed, while if an instance of the child class calls the method, the version defined in the Child class will be called.</p>

					<p>This property of redifing the method of a parent class in a child class us called <em>method overriding.</em></p>
